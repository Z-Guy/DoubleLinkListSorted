# DoubleLinkListSorted
A Doubly Linklist of Strings is given in an unsorted order. 

The following porogram sorts the list of String in alphabetical order with both iteration and recursion. 

For example, if the list of stings is {part, mart, dart, cart, art}, both methods should result in {art, cart, dart, mart, part}.
