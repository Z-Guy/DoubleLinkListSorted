# DoubleLinkListSorted
A Doubly Linklist of Strings is given in an unsorted order. 

The following code creates the foundation for a String-based LinkedList with the ability to find, add, delete, and print words.

The main purpose of the program is to sort the list of Strings in alphabetical order with the option of either an iteration method or a recursion method. 

For example, if the list of stings is {part, mart, dart, cart, art}, both methods should result in {art, cart, dart, mart, part}.
